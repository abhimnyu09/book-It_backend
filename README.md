## ðŸ”§ How to Run Locally

Follow these instructions to get the server running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (v18.x or higher)
* npm
* A **MongoDB Atlas** account (or a local MongoDB instance).

### Setup and Run

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/abhimnyu09/book-It_backend
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd book-It_backend
    ```

3.  **Install all dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Create your Environment File:**
    You must create a file named `.env` in the root of this project.
    ```bash
    touch .env
    ```

5.  **Add your MongoDB Connection String to `.env`:**
    Open the `.env` file and add your MongoDB Atlas connection string. Make sure to include your database name (e.g., `booklt`) in the string.
    ```
    MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@your-cluster.mongodb.net/booklt?retryWrites=true&w=majority
    ```
    *(Remember to URL-encode special characters in your password, like replacing `@` with `%40`)*

6.  **Run the development server:**
    The server will automatically connect to your database and populate it with sample data if the collections are empty.
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

The server will start on **`http://localhost:4000`**.
